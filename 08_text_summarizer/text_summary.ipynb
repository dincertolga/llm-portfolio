    "\n",
    "If you have any complaint to make about the results of your efforts hitherto, or about myself as your commander, there is no more to say. But let me remind you: through your courage and endurance you have gained possession of Ionia, the Hellespont, both Phrygias, Cappadocia, Paphlagonia, Lydia, Caria, Lycia, Pamphylia, Phoenicia, and Egypt; the Greek part of Libya is now yours, together with much of Arabia, lowland Syria, Mesopotamia, Babylon, and Susia; Persia and Media with all the territories either formerly controlled by them or not are in your hands; you have made yourselves masters of the lands beyond the Caspian Gates, beyond the Caucasus, beyond the Tanais, of Bactria, Hyrcania, and the Hyrcanian sea; we have driven the Scythians back into the desert; and Indus and Hydaspes, Acesines and Hydraotes flow now through country which is ours. With all that accomplished, why do you hesitate to extend the power of Macedon–yourpower–to the Hyphasis and the tribes on the other side ? Are you afraid that a few natives who may still be left will offer opposition? Come, come! These natives either surrender without a blow or are caught on the run–or leave their country undefended for your taking; and when we take it, we make a present of it to those who have joined us of their own free will and fight on our side.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a man who is a man, work, in my belief, if it is directed to noble ends, has no object beyond itself; none the less, if any of you wish to know what limit may be set to this particular camapaign, let me tell you that the area of country still ahead of us, from here to the Ganges and the Eastern ocean, is comparatively small. You will undoubtedly find that this ocean is connected with the Hyrcanian Sea, for the great Stream of Ocean encircles the earth. Moreover I shall prove to you, my friends, that the Indian and Persian Gulfs and the Hyrcanian Sea are all three connected and continuous. Our ships will sail round from the Persian Gulf to Libya as far as the Pillars of Hercules, whence all Libya to the eastward will soon be ours, and all Asia too, and to this empire there will be no boundaries but what God Himself has made for the whole world.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if you turn back now, there will remain unconquered many warlike peoples between the Hyphasis and the Eastern Ocean, and many more to the northward and the Hyrcanian Sea, with the Scythians, too, not far away; so that if we withdraw now there is a danger that the territory which we do not yet securely hold may be stirred to revolt by some nation or other we have not yet forced into submission. Should that happen, all that we have done and suffered will have proved fruitless–or we shall be faced with the task of doing it over again from the beginning. Gentlemen of Macedon, and you, my friends and allies, this must not be. Stand firm; for well you know that hardship and danger are the price of glory, and that sweet is the savour of a life of courage and of deathless renown beyond the grave.\n",
    "\n",
    "Are you not aware that if Heracles, my ancestor, had gone no further than Tiryns or Argos–or even than the Peloponnese or Thebes–he could never have won the glory which changed him from a man into a god, actual or apparent? Even Dionysus, who is a god indeed, in a sense beyond what is applicable to Heracles, faced not a few laborious tasks; yet we have done more: we have passed beyond Nysa and we have taken the rock of Aornos which Heracles himself could not take. Come, then; add the rest of Asia to what you already possess–a small addition to the great sum of your conquests. What great or noble work could we ourselves have achieved had we thought it enough, living at ease in Macedon, merely to guard our homes, accepting no burden beyond checking the encroachment of the Thracians on our borders, or the Illyrians and Triballians, or perhaps such Greeks as might prove a menace to our comfort ?\n",
    "\n",
    "I could not have blamed you for being the first to lose heart if I, your commander, had not shared in your exhausting marches and your perilous campaigns; it would have been natural enough if you had done all the work merely for others to reap the reward. But it is not so. You and I, gentlemen, have shared the labour and shared the danger, and the rewards are for us all. The conquered territory belongs to you; from your ranks the governors of it are chosen; already the greater part of its treasure passes into your hands, and when all Asia is overrun, then indeed I will go further than the mere satisfaction of our ambitions: the utmost hopes of riches or power which each one of you cherishes will be far surpassed, and whoever wishes to return home will be allowed to go, either with me or without me. I will make those who stay the envy of those who return.\"\"\""

       "\"Konuşma özeti: Beyler, yeni bir girişime öncülük etmek istediğimde, artık eski ruhla beni takip etmiyorsunuz. Kararı birlikte vermeyi amaçladığımız için burada buluşmanızı istedim: Benim önerim üzerine ilerlemeye mi devam edeceğiz, yoksa sizin önerinize göre geri mi döneceğiz?\\n\\nŞimdiye kadar yaptığınız çabaların sonuçlarıyla veya benim komutanınız olarak kendimle ilgili herhangi bir şikayetiniz varsa, daha fazla söylenecek bir şey yok. Ancak hatırlatmak istiyorum: Cesaretiniz ve dayanıklılığınız sayesinde İyonya, Gelibolu Boğazı, her iki Frigya, Kapadokya, Paphlagonia, Lydia, Caria, Lycia, Pamphylia, Fenike ve Mısır'ı ele geçirdiniz; Yunanistan'ın Libya kısmı şimdi sizin, Arabistan'ın büyük bir kısmı da sizindir, düşük seviyeli Suriye, Mezopotamya, Babil ve Susia; Pers ve Medya'nın kontrol ettiği veya etmediği tüm bölgeler sizin elinizde; Hazar Kapıları'nın ötesindeki topraklarda hakimiyet kurduk, Kafkasya'nın ötesinde, Tanais Nehri'nin ötesinde, Bactria, Hyrcania ve Hyrcanian Denizi'nde; Sarmatları çöle geri püskürttük; ve Indus, Hydaspes, Acesines ve Hydraotes, şu anda bizim olduğumuz topraklardan akıyor. Tüm bunlar başarıldıktan sonra, neden Makedonya'nın gücünü - sizin gücünüzü - Hyphasis ve diğer taraftaki kabilelere kadar genişletmekte tereddüt ediyorsunuz? Hala direniş gösterebilecek birkaç yerli mi korkuyorsunuz? Gel, gel! Bu yerliler ya bir darbeyle teslim oluyor ya da kaçarken yakalanıyor - veya ülkelerini savunmasız bırakıyorlar, biz de alıyoruz; ve aldığımızda, yanımıza katılan ve kendi istekleriyle savaşanlara hediye ediyoruz.\\n\\nBir insan için, benim inancıma göre, asil amaçlar doğrultusunda yönlendirilen çalışmanın kendinden başka bir amacı yoktur; yine de, bu özel kampanyaya ne gibi bir sınırın konulabileceğini merak edenler varsa, şunu söyleyeyim ki, önümüzdeki alan, buradan Ganges ve Doğu okyanusu'na kadar olan alan, görece küçüktür. Şüphesiz ki bu okyanusun Hyrcanian Denizi'ne bağlı olduğunu kanıtlayacağım, çünkü Büyük Okyanus Akıntısı dünyayı çevreler. Dahası, dostlarım, Hint ve Fars Körfezleri ile Hyrcanian Denizi'nin üçü de birbirine bağlı ve süreklidir. Gemilerimiz, Hazar Körfezi'nden Libya'ya, oradan da Kartaca Sütunları'na kadar dolaşacak, böylece Libya'nın doğusuna kadar ve tüm Asya'ya da hükmetmiş olacağız, ve bu imparatorluğun sınırları, Tanrı'nın tüm dünya için belirlediği sınırlardan başka bir şey olmayacak.\\n\\nAncak şimdi geri dönersek, Hyphasis ve Doğu Okyanusu arasında hala birçok savaşçı halk kalacak, Kuzey'e ve Hyrcanian Denizi'ne daha fazlası olacak, ayrıca Sarmatlar da çok uzakta değil; bu nedenle şu anda hala güvenli bir şekilde elinde tutmadığımız topraklar, daha önce boyun eğdirmeyi başaramadığımız bazı uluslar tarafından isyan çıkarılma tehlikesiyle karşı karşıya kalabilir. Eğer böyle bir şey olursa, yaptığımız ve çektiğimiz tüm şeyler boşa çıkmış olacak - veya baştan başlamak zorunda kalacağız. Makedonya beyleri ve dostlarım, bu olmamalı. Sarsılmayın; çünkü zorluk ve tehlike, şöhretin bedelidir ve cesaret dolu bir yaşamın ve ölümsüz bir ünün mezarın ötesindeki tatlı tadıdır.\\n\\nBilmiyor musunuz ki, eğer atam Heracles, sadece Tiryns veya Argos'a veya hatta Peloponez veya Thebai'ye gitseydi, kendisini tanrıdan bir insana dönüştüren şanı elde edemezdi miydi? Gerçekten de Tanrı olan Dionysus bile birkaç zorlu görevle karşı karşıya kaldı; ama biz daha fazlasını yaptık: Nysa'nın ötesine geçtik ve Heracles'ın bile alamadığı Aornos kayasını aldık. Öyleyse, şimdikinden daha fazlasını ekleyin zaten sahip olduğunuz Asya'ya - büyük fethinizin küçük bir eklemesi. Hangi büyük veya asil işi başarabilirdik ki, Makedonya'da rahat bir şekilde yaşayarak, sadece evlerimizi korumakla yetinsek, sınırlarımızdaki Trakyalıların ilerlemesini, İliryalıları ve Triballileri engelleme yükünü kabul etmeden veya rahatımızı tehdit edebilecek Yunanlıların kontrol altına alınmasını kabul etmeden?\\n\\nEğer komutanınız olarak ben de yorucu yürüyüşlerinizde ve tehlikeli kampanyalarınızda sizinle aynı kaderi paylaşmasaydım, ilk umudu kaybetmenizi suçlayamazdım; çalışmanın tüm meyvelerini başkalarının toplaması için sizin tüm işi yapmanız doğal olurdu. Ama öyle değil. Sizler ve ben, beyler, çalışmanın yükünü ve tehlikesini paylaştık ve ödüller hepimiz için. Fethedilen topraklar size aittir; yöneticileri sizin aranızdan seçilir; zaten en büyük hazinelerinin çoğu sizin ellerinizde geçiyor ve tüm Asya ele geçirildiğinde, gerçekten de hırslarımızı tatmin etmekten daha ileri gideceğim: her birinizin beslediği zenginlik veya güç umutlarınızın hepsi çok aşılacak ve evine dönmek isteyen herkese, benimle veya ben olmadan gitme izni verilecek. Kalanlara, dönenlerin kıskanacağı bir şey yapacağım.\""

       "[Document(page_content='Ancient History Sourcebook:   \\nArrian: Speech of Alexander the Great,   \\nfrom  The Campaigns of Alexander  \\n \\nI observe, gentlemen, that when I would lead you on a new venture you no longer \\nfollow me with your old spirit. I ha ve asked you to meet me that we may come to a \\ndecision together: are we, upon my advice, to go forward, or, upon yours, to turn \\nback?  \\nIf you have any complaint to make about the results of your efforts hitherto, or about \\nmyself as your commander, there is no more to say. But let me remind you: through \\nyour courage and endurance you have gained possession of Ionia, the Hellespont, both \\nPhrygias, Cappadocia, Paphlagonia, Lydia, Caria, Lycia, Pamphylia, Phoenicia, and \\nEgypt; the Greek part of Libya is now your s, together with much of Arabia, lowland \\nSyria, Mesopotamia, Babylon, and Susia; Persia and Media with all the territories \\neither formerly controlled by them or not are in your hands; you have made \\nyourselves masters of the lands beyond the Caspian Gates, beyond the Caucasus, \\nbeyond the Tanais, of Bactria, Hyrcania, and the Hyrcanian sea; we have driven the \\nScythians back into the desert; and Indus and Hydaspes, Acesines and Hydraotes flow \\nnow through country which is ours. With all that accomplished, why d o you hesitate \\nto extend the power of Macedon --yourpower --to the Hyphasis and the tribes on the \\nother side ? Are you afraid that a few natives who may still be left will offer \\nopposition? Come, come! These natives either surrender without a blow or are cau ght \\non the run --or leave their country undefended for your taking; and when we take it, we \\nmake a present of it to those who have joined us of their own free will and fight on \\nour side.  \\nFor a man who  is a man, work, in my belief, if it is directed to noble ends, has no \\nobject beyond itself; none the less, if any of you wish to know what limit may be set \\nto this particular camapaign, let me tell you that the area of country still ahead of us, \\nfrom here to the Ganges and the Eastern ocean, is comparatively small. You will \\nundoubtedly find that this ocean is connected with the Hyrcanian Sea, for the great \\nStream of Ocean encircles the earth. Moreover I shall prove to you, my friends, that \\nthe Indian and Persi an Gulfs and the Hyrcanian Sea are all three connected and \\ncontinuous. Our ships will sail round from the Persian Gulf to Libya as far as the \\nPillars of Hercules, whence all Libya to the eastward will soon be ours, and all Asia \\ntoo, and to this empire ther e will be no boundaries but what God Himself has made \\nfor the whole world.  But if you turn back now, there will remain unconquered many warlike peoples \\nbetween the Hyphasis and the Eastern Ocean, and many more to the northward and \\nthe Hyrcanian Sea, with t he Scythians, too, not far away; so that if we withdraw now \\nthere is a danger that the territory which we do not yet securely hold may be stirred to \\nrevolt by some nation or other we have not yet forced into submission. Should that \\nhappen, all that we have  done and suffered will have proved fruitless --or we shall be \\nfaced with the task of doing it over again from the beginning. Gentlemen of Macedon, \\nand you, my friends and allies, this must not be. Stand firm; for well you know that \\nhardship and danger are the price of glory, and that sweet is the savour of a life of \\ncourage and of deathless renown beyond the grave.  \\nAre you not aware that if Heracles, my ancestor, had gone no further than Tiryns or \\nArgos --or even than the Peloponnese or Thebes --he could neve r have won the glory \\nwhich changed him from a man into a god, actual or apparent?

The research paper titled \"Attention Is All You Need\" introduces the Transformer model, a network architecture based solely on attention mechanisms, without the use of recurrent or convolutional neural networks.\\n2. The Transformer model outperforms existing models in terms of translation quality, parallelizability, and training time.\\n3. The paper explains the use of attention mechanisms in the Transformer model, including dot-product attention and additive attention, as well as multi-head attention.\\n4. Attention is used in three ways in the Transformer model: encoder-decoder attention, self-attention in the encoder, and self-attention in the decoder.\\n5. The paper discusses the use of positional encoding to provide information about the relative or absolute position of tokens in the sequence.\\n6. The Transformer model replaces recurrent layers with multi-headed self-attention and achieves state-of-the-art results in English-French and English-German translation tasks.\\n7. The model was trained using one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs, employing regularization techniques such as residual dropout and label smoothing.\\n8. The Transformer model also performs well in English constituency parsing and has the potential to be applied to other tasks.\\n9. The paper includes acknowledgements and a list of references to related research papers.\\n10. Attention visualizations from the encoder self-attention in layer 5 of 6 demonstrate how different attention heads attend to different parts of the input.\\n\\nOverall, \"Attention Is All You Need\" presents the Transformer model as a powerful alternative to recurrent and convolutional neural networks, showcasing its superior performance in various tasks and highlighting the potential for further exploration and application.'"

The paper provides more context on the training process, including the use of byte-pair encoding and the hardware and schedule used for training. It also discusses the optimizer and regularization techniques employed. The paper presents results on machine translation tasks, demonstrating that the Transformer outperforms previous state-of-the-art models in terms of BLEU scores while requiring less training cost. The paper also explores variations of the Transformer model and evaluates its performance on English constituency parsing, showing promising results. The authors conclude by expressing excitement about the future applications of attention-based models and their plans to extend the Transformer to other tasks.\n",

The paper provides more context on the training process, including the use of byte-pair encoding and the hardware and schedule used for training. It also discusses the optimizer and regularization techniques employed. The paper presents results on machine translation tasks, demonstrating that the Transformer outperforms previous state-of-the-art models in terms of BLEU scores while requiring less training cost. The paper also explores variations of the Transformer model and evaluates its performance on English constituency parsing, showing promising results. The authors conclude by expressing excitement about the future applications of attention-based models and their plans to extend the Transformer to other tasks. The paper also includes acknowledgements and references to related work.'"
