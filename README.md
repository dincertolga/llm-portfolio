# Portfolio on langchain GenAI applications
As an engineer specializing in image analysis and deep learning, I am exploring opportunities in generative AI.
This repo contains my introduction to LLM applications using langchain. 

Some of these applications have been deployed to huggingface spaces: https://huggingface.co/dincertolga
