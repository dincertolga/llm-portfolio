Corporate \\nTreasury Services revenues were up 2% to € 1.1 billion, while revenues in \\nInstitutional Client Services grew 12% to € 495 million and Business \\nBanking revenues grew 25% to € 364 million.  \\n• Investment Bank net revenues  were € 9.2 billion in 2023, down 9% year on \\nyear, or down 8% ex cluding the aforementioned DVA impacts. Fixed Income \\n& Currencies (FIC) revenues were € 8.0 billion, down 11%  from an \\nexceptionally strong prior year . Revenues in Foreign Exchange, Rates and \\nEmerging Markets were substantially lower, reflecting reduced levels of \\nvolatility and market activity ; this development was partly offset by strong \\ngrowth in Credit Trading . Revenues in Origination & Advisory rose  25% year \\non year  to € 1.2 billion , driven primarily by Debt Origination due to the non-\\nrecurrence of the prior year’s mark to market losses in Lev eraged Debt \\nCapital Markets. This more than offset a 38% decline in Advisory revenues \\nwhich reflected very low levels of industry activity (source: Dealogic ). In the \\nfourth quarter , Investment Bank revenues were up 10% year on year. FIC \\nrevenues were € 1.5 billion, up 1% over  the strong levels of the prior year \\nquarter . Credit Trading revenues were significantly higher, driven by \\nDistressed and improvements to the flow business,  while strong growth in \\nEmerging Markets was driven by increased client activity in Asia . This was \\npartly offset by lower revenues in Rates and Foreign Exchange compared to \\nthe high levels of the prior year quarter.  Origination & Advisory revenues \\ngrew by 56%  to € 305 million , driven by Debt Origination revenues , primarily \\nreflecting  improvements in Leveraged Debt Capital Markets which \\nbenefitted from a non -repeat of prior year hedge losses and a partial \\nrecovery in the industry fee pool (source: Dealogic ). \\n• Private Bank net revenues were € 9.6 billion in 2023, up 5%  year on year , \\nand up 10% if adjusted for the aforementioned specific items  booked  in the \\nInternational Private Bank.
